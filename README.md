Just a simple user interface for the board game [trax](http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/trax.html "rules"). This is the final project of a Java course during first year of a master's degree. 

For launching you can simply open the `trax.jar` file, if it does nothing use the `trax.bat` file or use the terminal command :
```Bash
java -jar trax.jar
```
